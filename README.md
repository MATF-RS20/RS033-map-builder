# Map builder

### Info

This is a 2D terrain builder/maker with an idea to make a lot of playable maps for a variety of board games (i.e. Dungeons & Dragons) and improve experience of the games itself or at least enable users to express their creativity.

The idea is based on the WarcraftIII map builder, with variety of assets (including creatures) and architecture choices, multiple map sizes and common tool options.
